        <h1 id="isuna">Isuna</h1>
        <p>Isuna is a module-based organization tool that helps cosplayers control all aspects of their cosplays, from planning to the final result.
        </p>

        <h2 id="timely-market">Timely market</h2>
        <p>At the Apple Developer Academy, we had the chance to develop an application for the iOS platform with the theme, market and team of our choosing. Based on research and meetings, we decided to work with the cosplay market, an activity that consists of creating clothing focused on characters from series, games, movies, etc. </p>
        <p>We observed here the possibility of reaching an audience that spends a large part of their time and money on their creations but does not have any type of product that meets their creative needs. This led us to start an immersion process that can be summarized in 3 steps:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><span>Face-to-face interviews</span> with cosplayers to find possible needs within the market. </li>

          <li><span>Quantitative forms</span> distributed in national and international communities. This survey was created based on the insights gained during the first interviews and led to a more comprehensive mapping of the market. </li>

          <li><span>Interviews through Discord, Skype and WhatsApp</span> with cosplayers who showed interest in participating through forms. Here we sought to learn more about the problems highlighted in the previous steps. We talked to casual cosplayers and influencers with more than 10,000 followers on social media.</li>

        </ul>

        <img id="isuna-map" src="images/isuna-map.svg" alt="Map of the world with the main interviewed countries highlighted">

      </div>


      <div class="project-content-container">

        <h2 id="modular-solution">Modular solution</h2>
        <p>During immersion, we noticed the amount of different media that our public uses for organizing and planning a cosplay, with several interviewees even adapting non-organizational tools to their needs. We noted here a niche with excellent opportunities of being successful and sustainable as a service or product. </p>
        <p>We started to shape this idea by getting to know the organization process thoroughly and structuring different cosplay creation methods. This, together with benchmarks and conversations directly with our audience, led us to an application with modules that fit each user's unique need for organization. </span></p>
        <p>The application allows the user to register a cosplay with its essential information and, from that moment onward, choose which module he wants to catalogue. The user could, for example, create a cosplay using only the notes and images module and exclude the module that focuses on the financial part of the process. </p>
        <p>An MVP was planned with the main modules for an initial launch based on the information structure we created alongside cosplayers, in addition to mapping future expansions to meet what our audience considered essential. This enabled the design of flows and wireframes for app development in a fast and efficient way. </p>

      </div>


      <div class="project-content-container">

        <h2 id="branding">Branding</h2>
        <p>We started to create the visual identity, essential for the dissemination of the app and the creation of a consistent design system. The cosplay culture guided the entire brand construction and visual identity, mainly the Japanese roots, due to its tremendous impact on the market: </p>

          <img id="isuna-branding" src="images/isuna-branding.webp" alt="isuna logo, typography, iconography and colour palette">
        </picture>

        <ul>
          <li><span>The Isuna brand</span> emerged as a combination of the words <span>I</span>shō (costume), Kyōyū <span>Su</span>ru (Share) and Kurieitibu<span>na</span>  (Creativity). This method of conjunction is typical in the Japanese language and was the same used for the creation of the expression kosupure, from which the word cosplay originated.
          </br>Furthermore, the logo refers to a fox mask, known in Japanese culture by the name Kitsune and as a being that changes its shape.
          </li>
          <li>The <span>Palette</span> was developed with the idea of achieving a colour system for each detail that makes up a cosplay, such as the progression of a piece. And, following market standards, it has a version for light and dark mode.</li>
          <li>Since most of the content is generated by the user through names and notes, the <span>typography</span> was chosen with the notion that it would need to accommodate different amounts and styles of text. </li>
          <li>One of the characteristics of cosplays is that a large number and variety of people are represented in this activity, which brought about the need for an accessible and comprehensive <span>iconography</span>. To that end, the application was developed in a way that disabled people and other audiences can be added according to users' demand.</li>
        </ul>

      </div>


      <div class="project-content-container">

        <h2 id="final-result">Final result</h2>
        <p>The last step was the creation of high-fidelity screens and the handoff for development. This entire process was done close to the developers, allowing for easy and hassle-free development, using as much as possible of what the iOS platform has to offer. </p>

        </picture>

      </div>


      <div class="project-content-container">

        <h2 id="post-launch">Post-launch and learning</h2>
        <p>The app was first launched on the Testflight platform for usability testing and feedback from other academy members, to correct or add essential functionality for a successful launch. Besides, the application was disseminated at events related to the cosplay area to acquire interest and contacts for future distribution. </p>
        <p>After the launch, the focus shifted to bug fixing and improving the base product for the community. Implementation of analytics and firebase helped immensely in this process, in addition to new conversations with influencers and our audience. Since the cosplay community is a united one, staying in contact with these individuals was of the utmost importance. </p>
        <p>Throughout the entire process of designing Isuna, learning to create a practical MVP was a significant challenge that we managed to overcome. This resulted in a consistent and smooth to maintain product due to the modular nature of the project. </p>
        <p>Plus, leading a team from the initial conception to the end produced incredible learning about the process of creating and monitoring a product. The opportunity to conduct interviews on an international level, in particular, has broadened my perspective of a product with worldwide possibilities. </p>
