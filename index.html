      <h1 id="isuna">Isuna</h1>
      <p>Isuna is a module-based organization tool that helps cosplayers control all aspects of their cosplays, from planning to the final result.
      </p>

      <h2 id="timely-market">Timely market</h2>
      <p>At the Apple Developer Academy, we had the chance to develop an application for the iOS platform with the theme, market and team of our choosing. Based on research and meetings, we decided to work with the cosplay market, an activity that
        consists of creating clothing focused on characters from series, games, movies, etc. </p>
      <p>We observed here the possibility of reaching an audience that spends a large part of their time and money on their creations but does not have any type of product that meets their creative needs. This led us to start an immersion process
        that can be summarized in 3 steps:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><span>Face-to-face interviews</span> with cosplayers to find possible needs within the market. </li>

        <li><span>Quantitative forms</span> distributed in national and international communities. This survey was created based on the insights gained during the first interviews and led to a more comprehensive mapping of the market. </li>

        <li><span>Interviews through Discord, Skype and WhatsApp</span> with cosplayers who showed interest in participating through forms. Here we sought to learn more about the problems highlighted in the previous steps. We talked to casual
          cosplayers and influencers with more than 10,000 followers on social media.</li>

      </ul>

      <img class="project-img" src="images/isuna-map.svg" alt="Map of the world with the main interviewed countries highlighted">


      <h2 id="modular-solution">Modular solution</h2>
      <p>During immersion, we noticed the amount of different media that our public uses for organizing and planning a cosplay, with several interviewees even adapting non-organizational tools to their needs. We noted here a niche with excellent
        opportunities of being successful and sustainable as a service or product. </p>
      <p>We started to shape this idea by getting to know the organization process thoroughly and structuring different cosplay creation methods. This, together with benchmarks and conversations directly with our audience, led us to an application
        with modules that fit each user's unique need for organization. </span></p>
      <p>The application allows the user to register a cosplay with its essential information and, from that moment onward, choose which module he wants to catalogue. The user could, for example, create a cosplay using only the notes and images
        module and exclude the module that focuses on the financial part of the process. </p>
      <p>An MVP was planned with the main modules for an initial launch based on the information structure we created alongside cosplayers, in addition to mapping future expansions to meet what our audience considered essential. This enabled the
        design of flows and wireframes for app development in a fast and efficient way. </p>

        <img src="images/isuna-architecture.webp" alt="Architecture of the cosplay process">
      </picture>

      <h2 id="branding">Branding</h2>
      <p>We started to create the visual identity, essential for the dissemination of the app and the creation of a consistent design system. The cosplay culture guided the entire brand construction and visual identity, mainly the Japanese roots,
        due to its tremendous impact on the market: </p>

      <picture class="project-img">
        <source srcset="images/isuna-branding.png" type="image/png">
        <img src="images/isuna-branding.webp" alt="isuna logo, typography, iconography and colour palette">
      </picture>

      <ul>
        <li><span>The Isuna brand</span> emerged as a combination of the words <span>I</span>shō (costume), Kyōyū <span>Su</span>ru (Share) and Kurieitibu<span>na</span> (Creativity). This method of conjunction is typical in the Japanese language
          and was the same used for the creation of the expression kosupure, from which the word cosplay originated.
          </br>Furthermore, the logo refers to a fox mask, known in Japanese culture by the name Kitsune and as a being that changes its shape.
        </li>
        <li>The <span>Palette</span> was developed with the idea of achieving a colour system for each detail that makes up a cosplay, such as the progression of a piece. And, following market standards, it has a version for light and dark mode.
        </li>
        <li>Since most of the content is generated by the user through names and notes, the <span>typography</span> was chosen with the notion that it would need to accommodate different amounts and styles of text. </li>
        <li>One of the characteristics of cosplays is that a large number and variety of people are represented in this activity, which brought about the need for an accessible and comprehensive <span>iconography</span>. To that end, the
          application was developed in a way that disabled people and other audiences can be added according to users' demand.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="final-result">Final result</h2>
      <p>The last step was the creation of high-fidelity screens and the handoff for development. This entire process was done close to the developers, allowing for easy and hassle-free development, using as much as possible of what the iOS
        platform has to offer. </p>

        <img src="images/isuna-screens.webp" alt="4 different isuna app screens">
      </picture>

      <h2 id="post-launch">Post-launch and learning</h2>
      <p>The app was first launched on the Testflight platform for usability testing and feedback from other academy members, to correct or add essential functionality for a successful launch. Besides, the application was disseminated at events
        related to the cosplay area to acquire interest and contacts for future distribution. </p>
      <p>After the launch, the focus shifted to bug fixing and improving the base product for the community. Implementation of analytics and firebase helped immensely in this process, in addition to new conversations with influencers and our
        audience. Since the cosplay community is a united one, staying in contact with these individuals was of the utmost importance. </p>
      <p>Throughout the entire process of designing Isuna, learning to create a practical MVP was a significant challenge that we managed to overcome. This resulted in a consistent and smooth to maintain product due to the modular nature of the
        project. </p>
      <p>Plus, leading a team from the initial conception to the end produced incredible learning about the process of creating and monitoring a product. The opportunity to conduct interviews on an international level, in particular, has broadened
        my perspective of a product with worldwide possibilities. </p>

      <h1 id="hubster">Hubster</h1>
      <p>Hubster allowed me to work with two different components that make up a successful platform: the internal organization through a design system and the acquisition of new users.</p>

      <h2 id="aggravating-problem">Aggravating problem</h2>
      <p>Despite having a visual identity, the internal decentralization of these elements caused difficulties in the production of new features and screens.</p>
      <p>As a product designer, my goal was to bring an efficient method of organization and documentation into the platform, in other words, a Design System. I also worked on introducing new elements as needed and assessing the success of new
        implementations both inside and outside the company.</p>

      <h2 id="atomic-organization">Atomic organization</h2>
      <p>The first step was to find a method of organization that would document existing content clearly and serve as a basis for future additions. This is a crucial step for admitting the system within the company since a design system does not
        reach its true potential without being understood and influenced by all product stakeholders.</p>
      <p>After benchmarks and studies regarding different options, I decided to use the atomic method of organization. This method is based on dividing the screens into smaller and smaller components until reaching the minimum base, such as
        individual text fields or buttons. The atomic model makes it possible to easily update several product features by modifying only a few base components.</p>
      <p>I conducted tests to find out what would be the best type of terminology and workflow, considering the profile of each team within Hubster. Although the atomic model serves as an important basis, a design system really shows its potential
        when the company takes ownership and modifies it to create a comfortable and efficient relationship between the squads and the product they develop. The design system should be something natural and not an obligation.</p>

      <h2 id="design-system">Design system</h2>
      <p>The design system started with the development and presentation of Key Visuals with the changes implemented - revised colour palette, typography and iconography - for the team. Due to the disorder of interface components, certain elements
        did not dialogue and impaired the platform's consistency and usability.</p>

      <picture class="project-img">
        <source srcset="images/hubster-kv1.png" type="image/png">
        <img src="images/hubster-kv1.webp" alt="First key visual developed for Hubster new design system.">
      </picture>

      <p>Finally, with the details aligned and Key Visuals approved, I was able to start working on the organization and standardization of components. Following the grids and layouts presented, I tried to achieve greater consistency within the
        interface, making changes and introducing new elements where necessary.</p>

      </picture>

      <h2 id="applications-and-results">Applications and results</h2>
      <p>After implementing the design system, I had the opportunity to work on the organization of acquisition processes. This project went far beyond just the design system, also involving studies of how customer acquisition and service within
        the company worked and where they could be improved, both internally and externally.</p>

        <img src="images/hubster-flux.webp" alt="First key visual developed for Hubster new design system.">
      </picture>
      <p>With the mapping created, I was responsible for applying the design system to a new version of the homepage to reduce the bounce rate, generate new leads and make the experience of knowing the Hubster brand more pleasant.</p>
      <p>I also followed up with other designers on the team to check the implementation of the new organization, thus speeding up the creation of high-fidelity prototypes.</p>

      <h1 id="btwa">Before, there was Ava</h1>
      <p>Before, there was Ava is a story-rich indie adventure game about friendship, self-discovery, and a disturbing truth. Investigate a mystery as you explore an eerie farm, meet peculiar people, and delve into why Kiska is behaving unlike
        herself.</p>

      <h2 id="background-research">Background research</h2>
      <p>This project came to life because of our frustration with the predictability of horror films. We started with the investigation of what entertainment is and why the recurring use of clichés in this medium negatively impacts the experience.
      </p>
      <p>We came to two conclusions: in narratives, the unexpected is a pleasant event; and if it is the expectations set by the user that lead to surprise, breaking them is capable of generating highly satisfying experiences. With that, we chose to
        create a game that would be detached from the clichés and stigmas prevalent in entertainment, breaking the expectations of what the user believes to be common, essentially in the way he interacts with the medium.</p>
      <p>Recognizing the impact of entertainment on the perception of certain subjects by society, we chose Dissociative Identity Disorder as a theme. Often misrepresented by the media - especially in films - that perpetuate harmful stigmas through
        the mere desire to create more interesting and dramatic narratives, DID provided us with the opportunity to offer a good representation while having a significant impact on the user who lives the story, rather than just watches it. This
        happens because games insert the user in the magic circle, with the ability to suspend disbelief and put him in front of a situation that he would not otherwise have access to, creating a unique experience.</p>

      <h2 id="creative-process">Creative process</h2>
      <p>We were inspired by the aesthetics and visuals – which are, when talking about games, different concepts – of Oxenfree and Night in the Woods, understanding the similarities between their characteristics and our own goals. We were guided by
        three core factors to define the target audience, but the most important was the ability of the player to immerse themselves in the magic circle so the story would cause the desired impact. Because of that, we studied how games like OneShot
        and Doki Doki! Literature Club broke the 4th wall, unravelling the player's character and addressing them as themselves.</p>
      <p>To create the story we had to think backwards, firstly focusing on our desired outcomes for the player, and then backtracking to outline the main plot at the same time we created our characters. Because we wanted the highest amount of
        immersion in the magic circle, the player's character had to be bland and full of ambiguity. We chose not to portray the DID in the first person since it is not our reality, and therefore we are incapable of creating an authentic portrayal.
        In this sense, the player isn't the main character of the story, but rather a companion to the protagonist's journey.</p>

      <video width="440" height="340" autoplay loop>
        <source src="images\btwa-bike.m4v" type="video/mp4">
      </video>

      <p>The story itself revolves around the main character Kiska and the trauma that led her to develop DID. The player has to navigate his friendship with Kiska, getting to know her 7 alters - also known as personality states - and trying to
        figure it out how this eerie farm they stumble upon relates to her past. It is, at the same time, about respecting boundaries, the impact of your choices and the importance of platonic relationships, and about investigating a thrilling
        mystery about a creepy cult.</p>

        </picture>

      <h2 id="key-design">Key design philosophies</h2>
      <p>There needs to be a symbiotic relationship between the story, mechanics and visuals of a game, while each element supports the main desired aesthetic. To maintain these links, we established 7 key design philosophies to guide the experience
        and connect the narrative with each new mechanic or art introduced to the game.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Expanding the 4th wall:</span> To take the experience beyond the game environment, and including the real-world in the player's experience.</li>
        <li><span>The player as a character:</span> To allow the player to feel immersed through his inclusion in the story.</li>
        <li><span>Choices, choices, choices:</span> To give the player the possibility to make decisions during the game.</li>
        <li><span>Diversity of multiple paths:</span> To create consequences for the player's decisions and provide different events depending on his choices.</li>
        <li><span>Relationships that matter:</span> To give real meaning to the relationships that the player builds during the story, affected by his decisions.</li>
        <li><span>Different alters, different interactions:</span> Bring authenticity to Kiska’s condition through the different characteristics and interactions with each alter.The ordinary VS. the grim: The aesthetic must bring up a conflict
          between the ordinary world of the player and the mysterious and eerie events related to the story's mystery.</li>
        <li><span>The ordinary VS. the grim:</span> The aesthetic must bring up a conflict between the ordinary world of the player and the mysterious and eerie events related to the story's mystery.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

      <p>The game flow was developed with said philosophies in mind, especially those that specify choices and consequences. Before there was Ava has several possible paths and events that explore different aspects of Kiska's alters.</p>

        <img src="images\btwa-flow2.webp" alt="Game mechanics flow applied to a level">
      </picture>

      <p>To navigate this flow, we have the mechanics. Following the example of point & click games, the player can interact with the environment around him and chat with other characters, leading to multiple events and endings.</p>

      <h2 id="branding-visual">Branding and visual design</h2>
      <p>The brand of the game strengthen the story and its aesthetic, serving as a foreshadow. It guides the player, telling him what's important and encourages him to keep investigating, also highlighting an important part of the gameplay: dialogue
        with the alters. The remaining aspects: typography, colours and art style were chosen to be inline with the game's genre and target audience, reflecting its friendly and informal nature.</p>

        <picture class="project-img">
          <source srcset="images\btwa-speech.png" type="image/png">
          <img src="images\btwa-speech.webp" alt="An example of the game's interface with a speech bubble">
        </picture>

      <p>The interface/HUD was kept minimal to keep the immersion during the game, with the speech bubbles being the only element to be emphasized. They are a way of differentiating the alters during the gameplay, visually expressing their
        personality and speech patterns. The intention is for the player to see the difference, but it will only make sense as he progresses in the story.</p>

      <h2 id="playtests">Playtests</h2>
      <p>Two elements needed to be tested before the proof of concept was produced: the narrative, and the interface. As it is a narrative-driven game, the first qualitative test was a low-fidelity prototype which served, mainly, to confirm the
        player's engagement with the story and with the characters.</p>

        <picture class="project-img">
          <source srcset="images\btwa-twine.png" type="image/png">
          <img src="images\btwa-twine.webp" alt="An example of the game's interface with a speech bubble">
        </picture>

      <p>We produced on Twine a brief text adventure that allowed us to check the nuances of the characters' lines with twelve users - inside and outside of the target audience. This allowed us to judge the receptivity and choices made during the
        story by each player's profile.</p>

      <picture class="project-img">
          <source srcset="images\btwa-prototype.png" type="image/png">
          <img src="images\btwa-prototype.webp" alt="An example of the game's interface with a speech bubble">
        </picture>

      <p>In the second testing phase, we used a prototype created in Unity, implementing the interface and some other visual elements. In addition to testing the consistency of the interface with the target audience, it also allowed ten different
        users to point out development-related bugs.</p>
